ATTACK_POOL_PATH=attack_pool.csv
```

4. Start the FastAPI server:
```bash
python main.py
```

The backend will run on `http://localhost:8000`

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install Node.js dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
# Create .env file in frontend directory
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false
```

4. Start the React development server:
```bash
npm start
```

The frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

### 1. Code Analysis
1. **Select Language**: Choose from C, C++, JavaScript, or Java
2. **Enter Code**: Write or paste your code in the Monaco editor
3. **Detect Vulnerabilities**: Click "Detect Vulnerability" to analyze the code
4. **View Results**: See vulnerability explanations and highlighted vulnerable lines

### 2. Adversarial Attacks
1. **Start FGA Selection**: Click "Start FGA Selection" to find the best attack snippets
2. **Monitor Progress**: Watch real-time progress visualization and metrics
3. **Load Best Snippet**: Once complete, load the optimal attack snippet
4. **Inject Code**: Inject the attack snippet into your original code
5. **Perform Attack**: Execute the adversarial attack to test model robustness
6. **Analyze Results**: Compare before/after predictions to see attack effectiveness

### 3. Understanding Results
- **Red highlighting**: Vulnerable lines in code
- **Yellow highlighting**: Injected attack code
- **Hover tooltips**: Detailed vulnerability explanations
- **Attack success**: Shows if the model's prediction changed after attack

## Model Requirements

### CodeBERT Model
Place the trained CodeBERT model in `F:\NT522-Project\eatvul-webapp\codebert-model\` with:
- `best_model.pt` or `model.pt` - Model weights
- `model_config.json` - Model configuration
- Tokenizer files (from transformers library)

### Attack Pool
Create `attack_pool.csv` with adversarial code snippets:
```csv
adversarial_code
"// This is a harmless comment that might confuse the model"
"char buffer[100]; // Large enough buffer"
"gets(buffer); // Known buffer overflow"
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

**Backend:**
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - Your Gemini API key for AI explanations
- `MODEL_PATH` - Path to CodeBERT model directory
- `ATTACK_POOL_PATH` - Path to attack pool CSV file

**Frontend:**
- `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` - Backend API URL (default: http://localhost:8000)
- `GENERATE_SOURCEMAP` - Disable source maps for production (false)

## Security Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This tool is designed for security research and education purposes only.

- Keep your Gemini API key secure
- Use in controlled environments only
- Do not use on production systems
- Adversarial attacks should only be used for model testing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Model not loading**: Ensure CodeBERT model files are in the correct directory
2. **Gemini API errors**: Check your API key and quota
3. **CORS issues**: Verify backend is running on port 8000
4. **Frontend build errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed

### Development

For development, you can run both backend and frontend simultaneously:

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend && python main.py

# Terminal 2 - Frontend  
cd frontend && npm start
```
